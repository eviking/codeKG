# CodeKG Agent Index — codeKG
_Generated 2026-06-03 20:10 UTC · kept current by git commit triggers_

## How to use this index
These files are **always current** — regenerated automatically on every git commit.
Treat them as the primary source of truth for this codebase.
Read the files relevant to your task **before writing any code**.

**Before starting any task, read:**
1. `policies/active.md` — rules you must not violate
2. The relevant `modules/<name>.md` — classes, structure, key entry points
3. `architecture/hotspots.md` — if you plan to touch high-blast-radius classes
4. `insights/<name>.md` — non-obvious facts from previous sessions in this area

**Only call CodeKG MCP tools directly for:**
- Live impact analysis on files you just changed (`get_change_impact`)
- Full method-level class detail not in the module file (`get_class`)
- Searching for a class when you don't know its module (`search_classes`)
- Submitting session telemetry at the end of your task

| When you need to... | Read |
|---|---|
| Understand the repo structure | `architecture/modules.md` |
| Find key dependencies | `architecture/dependencies.md` |
| Check design patterns | `architecture/patterns.md` |
| Identify risky classes before changing | `architecture/hotspots.md` |
| Know the rules before making changes | `policies/active.md` |
| Check current violations | `policies/violations.md` |
| Work on a specific module | `modules/<name>.md` |
| Get non-obvious facts about a module | `insights/<name>.md` |
